It employs the matplotlib library to create an interactive environment that enables users to draw bounding boxes around the areas of images where destroyed buildings are present. These bounding boxes serve as annotations for machine learning tasks such as object detection. The script generates XML annotations for each bounding box, encapsulating essential information about the destroyed building's location and image attributes. This tool significantly streamlines the process of generating labeled data for training models to detect and analyze destroyed buildings within images."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1bc23abb","metadata":{"id":"1bc23abb"},"source":["**Import necessary libraries**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ab3c95a8","metadata":{"id":"ab3c95a8"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Add this line at the beginning of your Jupyter Notebook cell\n","%matplotlib notebook\n","\n","import os\n","import cv2\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from matplotlib.widgets import RectangleSelector\n","\n","import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n","from xml.dom import minidom"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f4663811","metadata":{"id":"f4663811"},"source":["**Definition**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e1f5df3c","metadata":{"id":"e1f5df3c"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","def line_select_callback(clk, rls):\n","    global tl_list\n","    global br_list\n","    tl_list.append((int(clk.xdata), int(clk.ydata)))\n","    br_list.append((int(rls.xdata), int(rls.ydata)))\n","\n","\n","def toggle_selector(event):\n","    toggle_selector.RS.set_active(True)\n","\n","\n","def onkeypress(event):\n","    global tl_list\n","    global br_list\n","    if event.key == 'q':\n","        generate_xml(tl_list, br_list, file_name, name_class)\n","        tl_list = []\n","        br_list = []\n","\n","\n","def generate_xml(tl_list, br_list, file_name, name_class):\n","    annotation = ET.Element(\"annotation\")\n","\n","    filename = ET.SubElement(annotation, \"filename\")\n","    filename.text = file_name\n","\n","    size = ET.SubElement(annotation, \"size\")\n","    width = ET.SubElement(size, \"width\")\n","    height = ET.SubElement(size, \"height\")\n","    depth = ET.SubElement(size, \"depth\")\n","    width.text = str(abs(tl_list[0][0] - br_list[0][0]))\n","    height.text = str(abs(tl_list[0][1] - br_list[0][1]))\n","    depth.text = \"3\"  # Assuming RGB images\n","\n","    object_elem = ET.SubElement(annotation, \"object\")\n","    name_elem = ET.SubElement(object_elem, \"name\")\n","    name_elem.text = name_class\n","\n","    bndbox = ET.SubElement(object_elem, \"bndbox\")\n","    xmin = ET.SubElement(bndbox, \"xmin\")\n","    ymin = ET.SubElement(bndbox, \"ymin\")\n","    xmax = ET.SubElement(bndbox, \"xmax\")\n","    ymax = ET.SubElement(bndbox, \"ymax\")\n","    xmin.text = str(tl_list[0][0])\n","    ymin.text = str(tl_list[0][1])\n","    xmax.text = str(br_list[0][0])\n","    ymax.text = str(br_list[0][1])\n","\n","    xml_str = ET.tostring(annotation, encoding=\"unicode\")\n","    dom = minidom.parseString(xml_str)\n","    pretty_xml_str = dom.toprettyxml()\n","\n","    xml_filename = os.path.join('annotations path', file_name.replace('.jpg', '.xml'))\n","    with open(xml_filename, \"w\") as xml_file:\n","        xml_file.write(pretty_xml_str)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"516f9c8c","metadata":{"id":"516f9c8c"},"source":["**Create Annotations**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"13724b07","metadata":{"id":"13724b07"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Main\n","image_folder = ''\n","file_name = ''\n","name_class = ''\n","\n","tl_list = []\n","br_list = []\n","file_names = os.listdir(image_folder)\n","\n","for file_name in file_names:\n","    if file_name[0] != '.':\n","        name_class, sep, tail = file_name.partition('_')\n","        dir_file = os.path.join(image_folder, file_name)\n","\n","        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n","        image = cv2.imread(dir_file)\n","        image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\n","        ax.imshow(image)\n","\n","        toggle_selector.RS = RectangleSelector(\n","            ax, line_select_callback,\n","            useblit=True,\n","            button=[1], minspanx=5, minspany=5,\n","            spancoords='pixels', interactive=True\n","        )\n","\n","        bbox = plt.connect('key_press_event', toggle_selector)\n","        key = plt.connect('key_press_event', onkeypress)\n","        plt.show()\n","\n","print('Number of Processed Images:', len(file_names))\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
